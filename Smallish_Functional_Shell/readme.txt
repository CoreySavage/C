OVERVIEW -
________________
This program is a small and functional shell. The shell allows for the redirection of standard input and standard output and supports both foreground and background processes.


The shell supports three built in commands: exit, cd, and status. It also supports comments, which are lines beginning with # (hashtag).


The general syntax of a command line is:

        command [arg1 arg2 ...] [< input_file] [> output_file] [&]
